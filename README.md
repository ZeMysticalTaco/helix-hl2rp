# helix-hl2rp
A personal fork of nutscript/hl2rp, ported to Helix.

# Helix and Nutscript

Nutscript was made by Chessnut and rebel1234.

Helix was made by `impulse, Alex Grist and nebulous.cloud

HL2RP was made by Chessnut, and if I'm remembering correctly, ported to 1.1 by rebel1234.

I just ported it to Helix, and any additional modifications, that I may make.

# Disclaimer

As far as I know, Alex intends to release an hl2rp schema to go with Helix when it's complete, however, I wanted to get to work ahead of time on porting stuff for ShockCore Gaming.

Helix is in an early stage of development, and things can and will break, when they change things.

Helix is also incomplete, and without proper knowledge, this can be difficult to run and setup, if you don't know what you're doing.
